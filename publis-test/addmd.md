# How to Review A Spec (as an Engineer)

This guide will serve as a living document to ensure that the Engineering team can provide robust feedback to PMs as they write specs. Our goal here is to ensure that we have a reference for common questions we need to ask as we consider work that may be picked up. It is the job of all engineers to ensure that before we accept a spec as "complete" we ensure that it is truly ready to start coding

> [!NOTE]
> This document covers just Spec documents and not Vision documents. They are high level and far reaching such that this level of detail is not needed yet. Some of these may apply there as well but most will be too specific.
